# Pir-Detection
This project has the purpose of monitoring intrusions through PIRs and send information with JSON to a Web page.
The scenario of the implementation of an intruder detection system is modeled using four PIR sensors. There are four rooms, each of which has a PIR. There is a monitor showing the activation of the sensors.
